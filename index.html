                        I'm talking about the kind that makes one pause mid-sentence, and realise -
                        "𝐖𝐚𝐢𝐭. 𝐒𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐞𝐞𝐦𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐞.  That small, often invisible movement.
                        That's the kind I chase.
                        That's the one hope Inner Leap™️ is built on.
                        
                        When I create specific session plans with art as my anchor, I don't start with textbook theory.
                        I build my activities around memories - happy and sad, distant and new.

                        Not loud, but deep, reflective, and rooted in lived experience.
                        
                        It didn't come from a textbook on mindset or corporate jargon on growth.
                        It came from change.
                        
                        From navigating burnout, grief, career pivots, and identity shifts. From losing people, roles, places, and still choosing to wake up, show up, and try again.
                        
                        That's how Inner Leap™️ was born.
